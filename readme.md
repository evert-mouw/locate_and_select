# Locate and Select

Use the `locate` command combined with
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
or [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi).

Using locate, you can quickly search for files.
This script helps you to

- quickly narrow the search; the results of locate
  will be piped to fzf or rofi
- open the selected file or directory in a file manager
